In medical settings, antiseptics are essential for preventing infections during surgeries, wound care, and patient prep. These products are utilized in hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities to maintain sterility and protect against microbial contamination. The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and a heightened focus on infection control in healthcare environments are driving the demand for effective skin antiseptics. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on preventive healthcare, which contributes to the higher adoption of antiseptic solutions in both routine and emergency medical procedures.</p><p>On the consumer front, skin antiseptic products are increasingly popular for personal hygiene and home care. The rise in awareness about hygiene and the prevention of infections, particularly following global health crises, has led to a surge in demand for over-the-counter antiseptic solutions. These products, including hand sanitizers and antiseptic wipes, are commonly used in everyday life to reduce the risk of infection and maintain cleanliness. The growing trend towards proactive health management and the convenience of portable antiseptic products are key factors fueling this segment's expansion.
